# Replicant

Ever needed to use a running application as template for a new project? ShapeShifter makes it easy to morph a living application into a completely new one.

## Roadmap

Our roadmap is publicly avaiable in a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/T9khQD2v/replicant-roadmap). Feel free to comment and suggest new features.
